	  						HACEY Health Initiative has created this privacy policy because we are commitment to protecting all platform usersâ€™ information. This policy pertains exclusively to the collection of personal information on the SALVUS website.

							Generally, HACEY does not automatically collect the identity of individual users of or visitors to official websites. Unless otherwise notified, information provided on this website may be shared among offices within the organisation, and outside third parties designated by the organisation as necessary or appropriate as requested by law. HACEY will never sell any identifiable information collected on this website.

						<h4>Data Security</h4>

						HACEY will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. It strives to implement security measures that protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

If your communication includes personal information that you do not wish to provide electronically, contact HACEY by postal mail or telephone.

						<h4>Cookies</h4>
	  					<p>
							HACEY employs "cookies" to provide a user with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of information our server asks your browser to store and give back to the server verbatim at a later time; cookie is used to make sure you get the same tailored information back when you visit. Our cookies do not store any personal information about you, nor are they able to access any information on your computer. Some organisation web pages may use cookies as a way to provide users with more tailored information when they return to those web pages. Users can set their browsers to receive notification when a web site sends them a cookie so users may accept or reject it.
